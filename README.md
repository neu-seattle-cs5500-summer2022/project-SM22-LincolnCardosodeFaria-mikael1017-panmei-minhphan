# What is .NET Core?
.NET Core is a new version of .Net framework, developed by Microsoft. It is an open-source framework for developing windows, web applications, services, and mobile applications and it can be run on Windows, Mac, or Linux. .Net Core application can run on both .NET CORE and traditional .NET Framework (.NET framework 4.x). It is completely rewritten from scratch and it was initially launched as .Net 5 but then it was renamed to .NET CORE 1.0.

In simple words, .Net Core is a Cross platform, High-performance, unified, fast, lightweight, Open-source framework for building modern, Mobile, web, windows applications and services.

# Why Use .Net Core?
- Cross platform - It can run on Windows, Linux and Mac.
- Unified - It offers a single unified component like .NET Standard library for all platforms with the same code, same languages, and same tools.
- Better performance - .Net core does not depend on system.web.dll for communication between Browser-server. In .Net core everything is packages which we need for our application. Packages reduce the request pipeline and improve the application performance.
- Lightweight - It is a lightweight framework. It allows developers to deploy libraries and components that are needed in a set of packages.
- Dependency Injection - Dependency Injection is in-built in .Net Core.
- Hosting - .Net Core application can be hosted on multiple Web server such as IIS, Apache, Docker, etc. It is not dependent on IIS.
- Open Source - It is a fully open-source framework. That means, it is free of cost and its source code is available.
- Testability - Unit testing is very easy in .Net core application.
- Side-by-side App Versioning - .Net Core runs on .NET Core, which supports simultaneously running in multiple versions of applications.
